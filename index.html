<p>Kay Flock was one of the rap scene's fastest emerging talents before his arrest. 
He amassed a fan base thanks to hits like "Opp Spotter," which included B-Lovee, 
"Brotherly Love," which featured B-Lovee and Dougie B, "Is Ya Ready," and the remix of 
"Being Honest." His first album, The D.O.A. Tape, was released by Capitol Records in
November 2021 and reached the top of Billboard's Heatseekers Album list.
A federal indictment names 19-year-old rapper Kay Flock of the Bronx,
claiming he is a member of a gang and has committed murder and racketeering.
Flock, real name Kevin Perez, faces the death penalty or a mandatory life term 
in jail without the chance of release if found guilty on the crimes.<p>

<p>The eight defendants in the indictment, who are purported members of the 
South Bronx-based Sev Side and Third Side gangs, were named in a news 
statement issued by the Department of Justice on Thursday, February 23.
The teams are charged with "attempted murder and assault with a dangerous 
weapon arising from seven shootings committed in the Bronx between June 2020
 and February 2022," according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The following are the charges brought against Kay Flock and the other 
gang members,as per the official Department of Justice website:<p>
